<p><strong>Course Description, Outcomes, and Student Learning Objectives:</strong></p>

<p>A study of global financial markets and operations of multinational firms. Topics include foreign exchange markets, balance of payments, international investment and banking, monetary and fiscal policy in an open economy, economic integration and monetary unification, and the international monetary system.</p>

<p>Managerial Finance (FIN3430) is the sole finance course in the busi­ness core. It emphasizes the creation of value in the corporation through the firm’s investing and financing decisions.

<p><strong>What I expect from you:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Coursework and Expectations:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>

<ol type="1">

<li>

<p>You are expected to attend all class periods, participate in discussions, and ask questions if/when necessary.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Homework and Problems: There will be Homework assignments and Problem Sets throughout the semester. Homework and Problem Sets will either be assigned in class or posted on Canvas. All homework assignments (both) may be completed in groups. I fully expect (and encourage) you to work together. However, remember that the tests will be done independently in class. So do not just copy other students work.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>You may use a computer to do any of your homework. But you need to make sure that you can complete the work on your calculator as well. For exams, you will only have access to your calculator.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Most homework assignments are based on completion and showing an effort to work the problems. Therefore, generally, they will only be worth about 5 points. Any late assignments will lose points depending on how late they are submitted.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>***Other assignments may be added as needed.*** </strong></p>

<p>Testing procedures: The course will have three exams that will cover a selection of the material. Additionally, the course will conclude with a final exam that will cover a portion of new material as well as a portion of the material previously covered in the earlier exams. All examinations will occur in class and on paper. <strong>(You may use a 4x6 inch notecard for your exam, but you must turn in your notecard along with the exam.)</strong></p>

<p>Timing of the exams: I am planning for our exams to occur approximately every four weeks. However, these times are not written in stone. They will occur when we have covered the appropriate material. We will discuss timing of the exams in class.</p>

<p><strong>Office hours -</strong> I will maintain office hours posted outside my office. This time is an extension of our class time. This time is reserved for you should you need to talk with me about class. If those times do not work for you, or something should arise outside of class or office hours, you may email me to schedule another meeting time. Please plan accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Phones and laptops in class –</strong> There will be no phone usage in class. Computer usage should be limited to course material during class. If you have a question regarding a homework or quiz question, you may discuss it with me after class or during office hours.</p>

<p><strong>Conduct:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Academic -</strong> Honesty and integrity are characteristics that should describe each one of us as servants of Jesus Christ. As your instructor, I pledge that I will strive for honesty and integrity in how I handle the content of this course and in how I interact with each of you. I ask that you join me in pledging to do the same.</p>

<p>Academic dishonesty will result in penalties up to and including dismissal from the class with a failing grade and will be reported to the Director of Academic Affairs. All instances of dishonesty will be handled according to the procedures delineated in the Harding University catalog.</p>

<p><strong>In short, if you can only pass one examination this semester, fail this course and pass the integrity exam that you take continually each day. The failure of this course can be remedied easily in a semester, but it will take much longer to rebuild a tarnished reputation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dress and personal -</strong> All members of the Harding community <strong>must</strong> dress with modesty and decency appropriate to the Christian lifestyle and consistent with professional employment standards. For these reasons, students are expected to adhere to a dress code, as described in the Student Handbook, which faculty, staff, and administration will enforce. Certain academic or extracurricular programs might have additional standards of dress.</p>

<p>“You don’t <em>have</em> a soul. You <em>are</em> a soul. You <em>have</em> a body.” – C.S. Lewis</p>

<p><strong><br /> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Syllabus Changes:</strong></p>

<p>I reserve the right to make changes as necessary to this syllabus. If changes are necessary during the term of the course, we will discuss these changes during our class time.</p>

<p><strong>Required Syllabus Statements:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Reasonable Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:</strong></p>

<p>Students with Disabilities: It is the policy for Harding University to accommodate students with disabilities, pursuant to federal and state law. Therefore, any student with a documented disability condition (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) who needs to arrange reasonable accommodations must contact the instructor and the Office of Disability Services and Educational Access at the beginning of each semester. If the diagnosis of the disability occurs during the academic year, the student must self-identify with the Office of Disability Services and Educational Access as soon as possible to get academic accommodations in place for the remainder of the semester. The Office of Disability Services and Educational Access is in Room 239 in the Student Center, telephone, (501) 279-4019.</p>

<p>If this applies to you, I urge you to communicate this with me at your earliest convenience (preferably today, right after class).</p>

<p><strong>STATEMENT ON THE USE OF GENERATIVE AI:</strong></p>

<p>The use of generative AI tools is not permitted for any assigned work in this class.</p>

<p><strong>CREDIT HOUR POLICY STATEMENT/TIME MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS</strong></p>

<p>For every course credit hour, the typical student should expect to spend at least three clock hours per week of concentrated attention on course-related work, including but not limited to time attending class, as well as out-of-class time spent reading, problem-solving, reviewing, organizing notes, preparing for upcoming quizzes/exams, developing and completing projects, and other activities that enhance learning. Thus, for a three-hour course, a typical student should expect to spend at least nine hours per week dedicated to the course.</p>
