    "text": "2.1 The Playing Field\nThink of the global financial marketplace as a complex ecosystem with three fundamental components:\n\n2.1.1 Securities (Financial Assets)\n\nAt the foundation are government debt securities - US Treasury Bonds, UK gilts, German bunds\nThese “risk-free” securities form the benchmark for pricing all other assets\nBuilt upon this foundation: corporate bonds, equities (stocks), bank loans\nMore recently: derivatives - financial instruments whose value derives from underlying assets\n\nCritical Point: The health of the global financial system depends on the quality of these securities. When securities fail (remember the 2008 financial crisis with mortgage-backed securities), the entire system suffers.\n\n\n2.1.2 Institutions\n\nCentral Banks: Create and control money supply (Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan)\nCommercial Banks: Take deposits and extend loans both domestically and internationally\nInvestment Banks & Financial Institutions: Trade securities, facilitate capital flows, create financial products\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Linkages - The Interbank Market\n\nThis is the “plumbing” of the global financial system\nUses CURRENCY as the medium of exchange\nHistorically centered on LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)\nImportant note: LIBOR is being phased out and replaced (we’ll study this in Chapter 8)",

There are different ways to express the same exchange rate:\n\nTraditional notation: $1.1274/€ (read as “1.1274 dollars per euro”)\nISO code format: USD1.1274 = EUR1.00\nFinancial press variations:\n\nEUR/USD 1.1274\nEUR-USD 1.1274\nEURUSD 1.1274\n\n\nAll mean the same thing! The key is understanding which currency is the “base” (the one that equals 1.00) and which is the “quote” (the price).\nConvention to Remember:\n\nEUR, GBP (British pound), and some Commonwealth currencies are typically quoted as “dollars per foreign currency”\nMost other currencies quote as “foreign currency per dollar”\n\nWhy does this matter? Because when you calculate percentage changes or returns, you need to know which currency is in the numerator and which is in the denominator.",

    "text": "2.3 Calculating Percentage Changes in Exchange Rates\nThis is critical - pay close attention.\nLet’s work through the Argentine peso example from your textbook:\nScenario: December 16, 2015 - Argentina lifts currency controls\n\nBeginning rate: ARG 9.7908 = USD 1.00\nEnding rate: ARG 13.6160 = USD 1.00\n\nQuestion: What happened to the peso’s value?\n\n2.3.1 Method 1 - Foreign Currency Terms (Foreign currency per USD)\n\n# Given exchange rates\nbegin_rate &lt;- 9.7908  # ARG per USD\nend_rate &lt;- 13.6160   # ARG per USD\n\n# Calculate percentage change\npct_change_method1 &lt;- ((begin_rate - end_rate) / end_rate) * 100\n\ncat(\"Method 1 Calculation:\\n\")\n\nMethod 1 Calculation:\n\ncat(\"Beginning rate: ARG\", begin_rate, \"= USD 1.00\\n\")\n\nBeginning rate: ARG 9.7908 = USD 1.00\n\ncat(\"Ending rate: ARG\", end_rate, \"= USD 1.00\\n\")\n\nEnding rate: ARG 13.616 = USD 1.00\n\ncat(\"Percentage change:\", round(pct_change_method1, 2), \"%\\n\")\n\nPercentage change: -28.09 %\n\n\nInterpretation: The peso FELL 28% in value. Notice:\n\nIt takes MORE pesos to buy one dollar (went from 9.79 to 13.62)\nThe calculation yielded a NEGATIVE number\nBoth indicate depreciation\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Method 2 - Home Currency Terms (USD per foreign currency)\nFirst, we need to flip the rates:\n\n# Convert to USD per ARG\nbegin_rate_usd &lt;- 1 / begin_rate\nend_rate_usd &lt;- 1 / end_rate\n\n# Calculate percentage change\npct_change_method2 &lt;- ((end_rate_usd - begin_rate_usd) / begin_rate_usd) * 100\n\ncat(\"Method 2 Calculation:\\n\")\n\nMethod 2 Calculation:\n\ncat(\"Beginning rate: USD\", round(begin_rate_usd, 5), \"= ARG 1.00\\n\")\n\nBeginning rate: USD 0.10214 = ARG 1.00\n\ncat(\"Ending rate: USD\", round(end_rate_usd, 5), \"= ARG 1.00\\n\")\n\nEnding rate: USD 0.07344 = ARG 1.00\n\ncat(\"Percentage change:\", round(pct_change_method2, 2), \"%\\n\")\n\nPercentage change: -28.09 %\n\n\nSame answer! The peso fell 28%.\nTeaching Point: Many students find Method 2 more intuitive because it follows the standard “end minus beginning over beginning” formula. However, both methods MUST give the same answer.\n\n\n2.3.3 Practice Problem\nIf the Mexican peso changes from MXN 16.00 = USD 1.00 to MXN 20.00 = USD 1.00, what is the percentage change?\n\n# Mexican peso example\nmxn_begin &lt;- 16.00\nmxn_end &lt;- 20.00\n\n# Calculate percentage change\nmxn_pct_change &lt;- ((mxn_begin - mxn_end) / mxn_end) * 100\n\ncat(\"Mexican Peso Change:\\n\")\n\nMexican Peso Change:\n\ncat(\"Answer:\", round(mxn_pct_change, 2), \"%\\n\")\n\nAnswer: -20 %",

This terminology predates the euro.\n\n2.4.1 Historical Origin (Fascinating backstory)\n\nBorn after WWII\nSoviet Union and Eastern European countries held US dollars\nFeared US government might freeze these dollar assets\nDeposited dollars in European banks instead (particularly in London)\nThe market grew from there\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Why Does This Market Exist and Thrive?\n\nRegulatory Arbitrage: Fewer regulations than domestic banking\n\nNo reserve requirements\nNo deposit insurance costs (like FDIC in the US)\nLess bureaucratic overhead\n\nNarrow Spreads: The difference between deposit and loan rates is often less than 1%\n\nWhy? Wholesale market (large transactions, $500,000+)\nCreditworthy borrowers (corporations, governments)\nLower overhead costs\n\nTwo Primary Functions:\n\nMoney market device: Corporations park excess cash, earning higher interest than domestic alternatives\nLending source: Companies borrow for working capital, trade finance\n\n\nLIBOR Connection: The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the benchmark interest rate for the eurocurrency market. It represents the rate at which banks lend to each other in London.\nCurrent Developments: LIBOR is being replaced due to manipulation scandals. We’ll explore this transition in detail in Chapter 8.",

Transfer Risk:\n\nBlocked funds (cannot repatriate earnings)\nExample: Argentina imposing currency controls\n\n2. Expropriation:\n\nGovernment seizure of assets\nMay or may not include compensation\nLess common today but still occurs\n\n3. Operational Restrictions:\n\nLocal content requirements\nTechnology transfer mandates\nForced joint ventures\nPrice controls\n\n4. Regulatory Changes:\n\nTax law changes\nLabor law changes\nEnvironmental regulation\n\nRecent Examples:\n\nRussia’s actions in Ukraine affecting Western companies\nChina’s regulatory crackdowns on tech companies\nIndia’s changing tax treatment of foreign firms\n\nKey Point: Political risk is hard to quantify, difficult to hedge, but absolutely must be considered in international investment decisions.",

Credit Risk Assessment:\n\nHow creditworthy is Mexican supplier?\nWill Canadian customer actually pay?\nDifferent business practices\nDifferent legal systems\nDifferent bankruptcy laws\nLess available information\n\nKey Point: Even in this relatively simple international trade phase, financial management complexity increases dramatically compared to purely domestic operations.",

Knowledge Seekers:\n\nAccess technology, expertise, innovation\nExample: Japanese and German companies buying US tech firms\n\n5. Political Safety Seekers:\n\nDiversify political risk\nExample: Hong Kong firms investing in Canada, Australia before 1997 Chinese takeover\n\nImportant Note: These are not mutually exclusive.
